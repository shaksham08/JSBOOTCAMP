# 1. HTTPrequestJS
There are 3 ways we can make the HTTP requests using JS asynchronously


  1. Using XMLHttpRequest
    
         -The original way of sending requests via JS
     
         - Does not support Promises, so lots of callbacks!
     

 

   2. Promises 
 
     
     - Promise is an object which run either success call back or reject callback
     - We make use of .then() and .catch() for this
     
 
      
   3. Axios 

     
     - This is a library which makes things very easy
     - Can be used in both frontend and backend(i.e NodejS)
   
# 2. Async and Await
